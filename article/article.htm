Title:       StringShear - A science project adventure in C# and C++
Description: A science program is rearranged and ported from C# to C++, with surprising results
Abstract:    You would think that C++ would run laps around C# for a science project,
             that taking the time to do things right in C++ would pay off big time.
             I explore the porting process and the performance measurement,
             and reach a startling conclusion.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        A little background.
    </p>
    <p>
        A million years ago, I was a stellar math and physics student.
        Let's say I peaked early...
    </p>
    <p>
        College math and physics were much harder than expected.
        I ended up meeting my wife and learning C++.
        Mission accomplished!
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside:
        When I entered college they taught new students like myself C++.
        When I left they were teaching noobs Java.
        Now they teach them Python.
        Alas.
    </p>
    <p>
        So even though physics didn't work out in college,
        I still dreampt of crazy delusional things like nuclear fusion.
        I wanted to get on a team doing that sort of thing,
        to save the world from wars over fossil fuels.
        Yep, crazy and delusional.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting Off To Do Science</h2>
    <p>
        So I took a third semester physics class from the local community college.
        The coolest experiment was "Simple Harmonic Motion On A String."
        In this experiment, there's a string suspended above a table.
        At one end the string is held fixed with a weight applied, creating tension.
        At the other end of the table the string is passed over an oscillator
        that moves that end of the string up and down.
        The oscillator's motion can be dialed in to a specific frequency,
        and, then, magic: Patterns called standing waves appear on the vibrating string.
        With what are called resonant frequencies, the standing waves become pronounced,
        and large patterns emerge in the vibrating string.
        This fascinated the hell out of me.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>
            <a target=_blank href="https://www.google.com/search?q=standing+waves+on+a+string&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgi_uG1-jyAhX3HjQIHd8xCdoQ_AUoA3oECAEQBQ&cshid=1630874100764215&biw=1280&bih=577"
               >Many great diagrams here</a>
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a software guy, I was inspired to take a diagram from the textbook
        and try to make a simulation of the standing waves string experiment.
        At the time, Microsoft was not giving away the crown jewels for free the way they
        have done with the Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 Community Editions.
        I wanted to do C++ programming, and the only way to do that back in the days of Visual Studio Express
        was .NET's C++/CLI, called Managed C++ at the time.  I hope you like carrots!
        It had a form designer, and the .NET library was quite workable.
        So I set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Weeks of development and tuning later, I had a working simulation.
        Tuning it took forever, for example my wife's revelation that the tension had to be quite high.
        There are a couple of these hard-fought magic numbers I had to hone in on
        to get it to where you can put in a frequency like 20 Hz and see a standing wave.
    </p>

    <h2>The User Interface</h2>
    <img src=screen.png width=600>
    <br clear=all>
    <p>
        At the left, top to bottom, are a real-time view of the string,
        and snapshots of the string when it was at its most extreme
        amplitude (height), velocity (up and down), acceleration, and punch (not fruit, change in acceleration).
        For each string, in the bottom-left you see the strings height at that moment (in millimeters),
        in the top right you see extreme value that was measured ("max = "),
        and in the bottom right you see the elapsed time ("time = ") in the simulation when the maximum was recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the right are the simulation controls.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Time Slice</b> is how quickly the simulation runs, in parts of a millisecond.
                Too high and the simulation is not realistic.
                Too low and the simulation runs too slowly.
                Best to not go higher that 0.01 ms.
                You might go lower to validate that something you observed
                is not some artifact of simulation overload from running too fast.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Simulation Speed</b> controls the delay in the simulation's update loop.
                For any real study you would run it at All Out for hours on end.
                You can use lower speeds to observe the string motion even slower.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tension / Root Note</b> is tricky.
                The number you see there is a magic number arrived at tuning the string to resonate at 10 Hz.
                You can enter music notes, like C0, and then instead of frequencies you can enter other musical notes,
                and see how consonance and dissonance play out on the string.
                Mad science.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Oscillators</b> define the vibrations made at the ends of the strings.
                Not limited to a single physical oscillator with a single frequency,
                you can enter whatever you'd like for either side or both, each frequency on its own line.
                Don't get carried away, though.
                With too many frequencies, especially high ones, you start to see un-string-like behavior.
                It's a difficult point, that to find anything interesting you have to go to lengths that might
                mean that what you're seeing isn't realistic.
                You can try lowering the Time Slice and running the simulation for longer to see if what you
                found is realistic.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Out of Phase</b> sets the offset in the left versus the right oscillators.
                If you put the same frequency on the left and right, and set this to zero,
                the string will just move up and down and no standing waves will form.
                In the real world, I was able to prove this out with a string between two oscillators.
                Only when I reverse wired them did a standing wave form.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Just Pulse</b> and <b>Just Half Pulse</b> let you see how a standing wave forms
                in the very beginning with just one wave front moving down the string and echoing back.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Run / Pause</b> controls the simulation, starting or pausing or restarting it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reset</b> turns the clock back to zero and resets all the strings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reset Maximums</b> resets just the maximum strings.
                This is useful after running a simulation for a little while,
                to eliminate the weird stuff that happens early in a simulation,
                to reproduce a legitimate finding of interest, if there were such things.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Copy Stats Header</b> puts the stats columns on the clipboard to paste into a spreadsheet program.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Copy Stats Values</b> puts the stats values on the clipboard to paste into a spreadsheet program.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><a target=_blank href="https://www.stringshear.com">stringshear.com</a></b>
                has an online TypeScript version of this project that you can play with,
                no need to download or build anything,
                and some documentation similar to this.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can tell you've got a strong standing wave when in the top-left panel, the black
        circles at either end of the string aren't moving up-and-down much, but the string is.
        That's the magic, the resonant frequencies,
        where the string resonates with the vibrations it's getting from its ends.
    </p>
    <p>
        Build it and plug in the frequencies you've got here, and watch how, in slow motion,
        the string moves, and maximum strings are recorded.
        It's mesmerizing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The science is interesting, but this is not a scientific journal.
        Let's talk code.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving On To The Code</h2>
    <p>
        Here are the projects in the attached code ZIP:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>original</b> - C# port of the truly original C++/CLI WinForms program (from 2007!)</li>
            <li><b>app</b> - C# WinForms UI client that runs the new client-server show</li>
            <li><b>sharpsvr</b> - C# HttpListener server that implements the simulation</li>
            <li><b>sharplib</b> - C# class library that implements the guts of sharpsvr, and implements inter-process communication</li>
            <li><b>seasvr</b> - C++ server that reimplements the simulation, with a little .../CLI just for the HttpListener serever code</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are the classes of interest,
        named and coded (mostly) the same in C# and C++ for easy comparison:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Simulation</b> - Runs the experiment, and does serialization and event handling with the app</li>
            <li><b>Stringy</b> - Well, I couldn't call it String!  Manages serialization and updating</li>
            <li><b>Particle</b> - Our string effectively consists of 1,000 strung beads...particles sound cooler than beads</li>
            <li><b>ScopeTiming</b> - Performance tracking</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Code Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
        In the original app, all the classes are in the one project.
        To do a performance comparison between C++ and C#
        - as I am prone to do! -
        I needed to run the simulators out of process, in a C# server and a C++ server.
        Okay, I didn't <b>need</b> to do it that way,
        but it's nice to be able to leave the simulation running for hours on end
        without having the app burning up the graphics card the whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general algorithm is...
        <ol>
            <li>
                The simulation is always running calling the Update function
                which simulates oscillators and updates strings and particles
            </li>
            <li>
                The simulation receives settings from the app to apply to itself
            </li>
            <li>
                This simulation serves its state (strings, maxes, etc.) as a web server for the app to query
            </li>
            <li>
                The app has controls for sending settings to the simulation to control it
            </li>
            <li>
                This app has a timer that queries the simulation for its state and updates the display
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        So my plan of attack was to follow these steps,
        validating that things still worked at each step:
        <ol>
            <li>Pull non-UI bits out of the app into a class library, sharplib</li>
            <li>Introduce serialization of app commands and simulation state between the sharplib classes and the app UI</li>
            <li>Write a HttpListener server, sharpsvr, and use a WebClient in the app, and do out-of-process communication between the UI and the simulation</li>
            <li>Port the server and most of sharplib into a C++ server, seasvr</li>
        </ol>
        Let's dive in!
    </p>

    <h3>The Particle Class - C#</h3>
    <p>
        The Stringy class has an array of Particles,

        NOTE:
        ToString turns out to be wicked fast,
        but FromString does not have to be fast as it's app side, running at human time,
        so it's meant to be readable, not fast.

        You can see that sending strings from the servers to the app, the Output steps,
        are quite different:
        30 C++ vs. 11 C# for ToString (wow!), and 4.7 vs. 6.7 for StreamWriter (strange!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Why is computing the std::string so much slower for C++ than doing StringBuilder in C#?
    </p>
    <p>
        And why is the StreamWriter step significantly slower for C#?
        The .NET code should be near identical in the two .NET Main function environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking into the performance of String.ToString, 
        the big difference is how the particles' text are added to the output.
        Which is baffling how C#'s $"{x}..." is faster than C++'s sprintf_s,
        or Linq and StringBuilder are faster that a loop over a vector and std::string concatenation.  
        A lot faster.  
        Riddle me that one!
    </p>
    <p>
        And the Update computational step is near identical between C++ and C#.  
        C# is even a little faster!
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion and Points of Interest</h2>
    <p>
        This has been a great game of software development, tuning, measurement, and optimization.
        The results are remarkable: there's no benefit to using C++ vs. C# for this application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back to mad science...
    </p>
    <p>
        You may be wondering where the name StringShear came from.
        If you're game, try picking some frequencies to shear the string, to cause a particle to fly off,
        or to see something interesting, and share what you found.
        Such repeatable, noteworthy findings could be of scientific value.
        Well, at least it's fun to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
        And have at the code, explore performance profiles by adding more timing, try speeding things up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enjoy!
